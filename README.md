## Installation

The server can be installed via `cargo` (or from source).

```sh

```

Then, you should be able to run the language server with the following command:

```sh

First, clone this repo and compile it.

```sh
git clone git@github.com/polarmutex/beancount-language-server.git

### Future

- updated vscode extension to use the rust version

## Editor Support

### Neovim

The settings for the language server are in the lspconfig repo

1. Install the beancount language server

   ```sh
   cargo install beancount-language-server
   ```

   However you install it, you need to remember how to access the binary

2. Create a lua lspconfig for the beancount LSP [example in my dotfiles](https://github.com/polarmutex/dotfiles/blob/master/neovim/lua/polarmutex/lsp/beancount.lua)

   - add the following code to your lspconfig

   ```lua
   local lspconfig = require 'lspconfig'
   lspconfig.beancount.setup= {
       init_options = {
           journal_file = "<path to journal file>",
       };
   };
   ```

3. Open a beancount file and verify LSP connected with the LSPInfo command

#### Troubleshooting

#### beancount file type not detected

If you notice beancount files not having the "beancount" type, you need a
neovim v0.5 or master built after Feb 17, 2021

If not the following in a file named `beancount.vim` in the `ftdetect` folder

```vim
function! s:setf(filetype) abort
    if &filetype !=# a:filetype
        let &filetype = a:filetype
    endif
endfunction

au BufNewFile,BufRead *.bean,*.beancount call s:setf('beancount')
```

### VS Code

Plan to make a VS Code extesion in the future

### Vim

Tested and Developed on Neovim v0.5 (master branch)
